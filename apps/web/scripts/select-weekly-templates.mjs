/**
 * Weekly template-generation helper: hands back the next chunk of candidate document-template
 * families from the ranked research pool, and advances a persisted cursor so the same rows
 * aren't handed out twice.
 *
 * This script does NOT decide what's a duplicate of an existing template, does NOT write any
 * template content, and does NOT run the site build — those are judgment calls for whoever
 * (or whatever agent) consumes this list, same as the original 1,000 templates were written by
 * hand across 21 sessions. This script only exists so nobody has to re-scan a 10k-row CSV by
 * hand each week to figure out where the last batch left off.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/select-weekly-templates.mjs [--window N] [--dry-run]
 *   --window N   candidates to return this run (default 150 — headroom over a 100/week target,
 *                since some candidates get skipped for being too close to an existing template)
 *   --dry-run    print the candidates but don't advance/persist the cursor
 *
 * Output: JSON to stdout — { cursorBefore, cursorAfter, poolExhausted, candidates: [...] }
 * where each candidate is { rank, uploadCount, family, source }.
